# Using a Predictive Model of Rugby Player Data to Rank International Leagues

In this project, I attempted to use data from [Its Rugby](https://itsrugby.co.uk) to create a ranking of the relative strengths of a handful of international leagues. To do this, I built a predictive model that can predict whether a player's minutes would increase after a change in leagues. I ran this model on a dataset of semi-random fake players and ranked the leagues based on how often the players' minutes are predicted to increase. I collected the relevant data using Beautiful Soup to parse HTML code from Its Rugby. 

All of the relevant code and explanations can be found [here](https://github.com/patrick-naylor/USING-A-PREDICTIVE-MODEL-OF-RUGBY-PLAYER-DATA-TO-RANK-INTERNATIONAL-LEAGUES/blob/main/Its_Rugby_Analysis.ipynb)
